StevenBlack Hosts File Downloader and Scheduler For Windows [10]

[*](https://tenor.com/view/takin-notes-taking-notes-notes-got-it-writing-it-down-gif-11069726) Tested On Windows 10 [1904] Only.

You only have to download and run [StevenBlack-Hosts-UNI.bat](https://github.com/M-Maaz-H/StevenBlackHosts-Auto/blob/main/StevenBlack-Hosts-UNI.bat).
Thats It.

By Default It Will Download [Unified hosts + fakenews + gambling + social](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/alternates/fakenews-gambling-social/hosts), But You Can Edit The Batch File To Download Any Hosts File.

For Scheduling Task Will Be Created, To Run [Hosts.bat](https://github.com/M-Maaz-H/StevenBlackHosts-Auto/blob/main/StevenBlack-Hosts-SCH-2.bat) On Weekly Basis (Ofcourse You Can Edit That Too).
[Hosts.bat](https://github.com/M-Maaz-H/StevenBlackHosts-Auto/blob/main/StevenBlack-Hosts-SCH-2.bat) Will Download The Latest Defined Hosts File And Replace It With The Current One. 

Thanks!
